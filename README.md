# PythonParts Examples

Example PythonParts for better understanding of Allplan Python API and PythonParts framework

This repository is an integral part of the Documentation of the PythonParts Framework
available on [pythonparts.allplan.com](https://pythonparts.allplan.com/latest).

If you don't know, what PythonParts Framework is, refer to

## Usage

1.  Switch to the branch adequate to the Allplan version you are using. You are now
    on the branch with examples for **ALLPLAN 2025**.
2.  Save the files to the **USR** location of your Allplan installation:

    *   Obtain the USR directory by opening Allmenu -> Service -> File explorer ->
        **My own CAD documents**

    *   The path usually looks like:

            C:\Users\your_username\Documents\Nemetschek\Allplan\your_version\Usr\Local

    *   Download the zip and extract **directly** to this location

3.  From now on, the examples can be started in Allplan from:

        Library -> Private -> Examples -> PythonParts
