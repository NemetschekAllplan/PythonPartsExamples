# PythonParts Examples

Example PythonParts for better understanding of ALLPLAN Python API and PythonParts framework

This repository is an integral part of the Documentation of the PythonParts Framework
available on [pythonparts.allplan.com](https://pythonparts.allplan.com/2025).

If you don't know, what PythonParts Framework is, refer to
[_getting started_](https://pythonparts.allplan.com/2025/manual/getting_started/)
section.

## Usage

To try out the examples, you will need ALLPLAN installed together with PythonParts SDK.
The first one can be downloaded from [ALLPLAN Connect](https://connect.allplan.com/).
The latter from the [online documentation](https://pythonparts.allplan.com/2025/manual/getting_started/)
of the PythonParts framework.

You can download the examples using a tool included in the SDK. Is you want
to install them **manually**, follow these steps:

1.  Switch to the branch adequate to the Allplan version you are using. You are now
    on the branch with examples for **ALLPLAN 2025**.
2.  Save the files to the **USR** location of your Allplan installation:

    *   Obtain the USR directory by opening Allmenu -> Service -> File explorer ->
        **My own CAD documents**

    *   The path usually looks like:

            C:\Users\your_username\Documents\Nemetschek\Allplan\your_version\Usr\Local

    *   Download the zip and extract **directly** to this location

3.  From now on, the examples can be started in Allplan from:

        Library -> Private -> Examples -> PythonParts
